# Extended-vanilla

Some abstractions for [pure-data](http://puredata.info).

## Why?

`pd-extended` users often tend to become lazy :mouse: and use some externals which only come with `pd-extended` although the same result can often be achieved with `pure-data` (vanilla).

I find that trying to work with `pure-data` (vanilla) as much as possible is good for the following reasons:

- that's an amazing brain exercise (think *puzzles*)
- that's a great teaching base to show to beginners and intermediate users
- 100% compatible with standard `pure-data` out-of-the-box

In my teaching experience, I found out that beginner users would grasp the "concepts" of `pure-data` faster after having patched everything by themselves with the basic building blocks instead of using the zillions of built externals that come with `pd-extended`.

This is of course for the **simpler tasks** (think about `counter`, ...), it's a great learning oportunity and it will make you a powerful user sooner than you think.


Don't get me wrong though, `pd-extended` team does *a great job* at providing users with **a lot** of built libraries, avoiding the hassle of trying to build them themselves, knowing that sometimes (often?), this process is poorly documented (if ever..).

I just think that **too much** is **less** :neckbeard:


## Contributions

Some of these abstractions might behave slightly differently than the original `pd-extended` externals.

Any corrections/contributions are very welcome!
